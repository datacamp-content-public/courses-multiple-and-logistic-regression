`@script`
When analysing a continuous response variable such as as a personâ€™s weight or annual income, we would normally use a simple linear regression model to explore possible relationships with other explanatory variables. But what if the response variable is binary or categorical such as win or loss, pass or fail, survival or death. In this video, we go ahead in the usual manner fitting a line to a binary response variable, see what is wrong, and make it right using a logit function of logistic regression.
